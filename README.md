Created a System for data extraction and Sentiment Analysis.
• Extract articles from a list of url in an excel sheet, the extracted data from each url is stored in
a .txt file.
• Then the text files are used to analyse the data to calculate positive scores, negative scores, fog
index etc. The values will be produced and stored in output.xlsx file.
